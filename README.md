# Kalman-Filter
Kalman filter graphical presentation

The programme is written in Java using NetBeans.

The programme:
 opens the 'measurements.txt' file and stores the actual and measured radiation values in a suitable data structure.
 accepts the parameters φ, σ1 and σ2 as input by the user.
 Calculates for each measured radiation value the corresponding value obtained using the Kalman filter.
 calculate and display the mean deviation (mean Euclidean distance) between 
  (a) actual values and measured values (noise), 
  (b) actual values and output values of the Kalman filter.
 Graphically displays the above points (actual values, measured values, Kalman filter estimates) with different colors 
and joining successive points (eg in the following points are represented in black, red, and blue color , respectively).


In KalmanFilter folder there are screenshots and the executable file KalmanFilter.jar 
All folder contents should  be downloaded in order to run the jar file.
